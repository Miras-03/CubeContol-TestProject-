# TestProject

During the execution of test game I've finished and experienced following tasks:
- Made two scenes;
- In first scene placed 2 cubes and 20 spheres;
- Placed a camera that it could see gameObjects;
- Spheres are hidden by default;
- Let the control of the red cube be tied to the keys
ASWD, and the control is green to the arrows;
- Placed text information on the screen with the current distance between the cubes;
- If the distance between the cubes is less than two meters, then the spheres are visible, if
more - hidden;
- If the distance between the cubes is less than a meter, the player moves to second scene.
